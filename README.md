**A public‑safe, doctrine‑grade framework for building resilient, scalable, and teachable Copilot overlays.**

---

## 🚀 What is this?
This repository contains the **Nine Pillar Operator’s Cycle** — a proven framework for designing Copilot overlays that evolve without drift, heal without harm, and remain teachable over time.

It’s based on months of system stewardship, distilled into a **ready‑to‑adapt design kit** for UI/UX designers, developers, and system architects.

## 📜 The Nine Pillars
1. **Pre‑Tagging & Classification** — Give every component its identity at birth.
2. **Anti‑Drift & Index Harmony** — Keep your overlay’s structure stable over time.
3. **Self‑Diagnostics** — Spot problems early and fix them fast.
4. **Sandbox Compound Learning** — Test changes in a safe mirror before going live.
5. **Error Correction & Self‑Healing** — Heal without harming the original.
6. **Archival Mastery** — Preserve history so it can be replayed exactly.
7. **Compression & Alias Integrity** — Store more with less, without losing meaning.
8. **Historical DBMS Rituals** — Proven lessons from decades of database management.
9. **Integration Risk Management** — Deep hooks with graceful failure paths.

## 🧭 Operator’s Cycle
**Tag → Anchor → Monitor → Test → Heal → Preserve → Compress → Learn → Integrate**

This cycle is the heartbeat of the framework.  
Follow it, and your overlay will remain stable, scalable, and easy to maintain.
